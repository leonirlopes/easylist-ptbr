# [Adblock Plus][0] rules for Brazilian Portuguese

Since the web has become hard to use without seeing advertisements,
solutions like [Adblock Plus][0] and [Adblock for Chrome][1] have
emerged.

Since those engines only deals with the *mechanics* of blocking content
from your browser, some way to tell them *what* to block is provided by
wonderful lists like the [EasyList][2] effort.

Alas, most content that we want to block may be dependent on the
location/origin of the site that we access: there are already lists for
Germany, France, Romania, among others, but it doesn't seem to exist one
that targets a high population: those from Brazil.

Enter this project: the goal is to (**collectively**) build a list of
rules that can be used as a supplement to EasyList for those that have
to live with Brazilian Portuguese sites.

To use this list, simply subscribe to the URL:

    https://raw.github.com/rbrito/easylist-ptbr/master/adblock-rules.txt

or [click here][3].

Please, spread the word about this effort and contribute your rules to a
nicer web experience (and faster/cheaper for those that are billed by
the amount of data transferred, as is the case of 3G users).

The list is under a ["Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution" License][4] and
comments via the issues tracker are highly appreciated.
